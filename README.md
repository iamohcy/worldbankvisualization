# worldbankvisualization
This data visualization uses data from the World Bank to chart a country’s relative developmental progress over the years 2000-2013. 
Developmental factors are grouped together in subsets such as Education, Population and Economy, and visualized in terms of the 
chosen country’s percentile ranking amongst all other countries with data values for that year.

Extremely unoptimized but should still run fine on most browsers. Todo: optimize + update data to present date
