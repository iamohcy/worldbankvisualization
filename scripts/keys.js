Firstly, Singapore has a very widespread and well-maintained road system, with one of the highest levels of road density in the world. Additionally, despite its urban and relatively affluent society, car ownership density remains low compared to other countries, due to a quote license scheme where aspiring car owners have to bid for a Certificate of Entitlement. Costs for a COE rang from 52,000 USD to 65,000 USD for just a compact vehicle, with full-sized sedan COEs going for up to > 100,000 USD."
